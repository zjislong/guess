Version 4.1.9
2018-Jun-14

        * Bugfix crash when using the renaming options such as
        msg_name_to_lower, when the protobuf files contains package
        definitions, and the use_packages option is not specified. Thanks
        to Mark Geib for reporting. (#139)

Version 4.1.8
2018-May-25

        * Use the OTP_RELEASE macro in generated code, so it can compile
        cleanly with different OTP versions.  The OTP_RELEASE will
        appear in Erlang 21; it has been merged to master, but it is not
        in Erlang 21-rc1, so still honour the GPB_FUNCTION_STACK and
        GPB_PATTERN_STACK macros described for 4.1.6 below.

Version 4.1.7
2018-May-13

        * Fix improper interpretation of nested extend block. If inside
        a message, extending another message, the surrounding message
        was wrongly extended, but this as now been fixed. Thanks to Paul
        Guyot for reporting.

Version 4.1.6
2018-May-08

        * Make the Erlang 21 stacktrace syntax choice overridable.
        In addition to the targetting version described in 4.1.5 below,
        make it possible to override the stacktrace selection:

        When targeting Erlang 21 or later, generate code that uses the new
        stacktrace syntax, but if the user defines 'GPB_FUNCTION_STACK' when
        compiling the generated code, it overrides.

        When targeting Erlang 20 or earlier, generate erlang:get_stacktrace/0
        calls, but if the user defines 'GPB_PATTERN_STACK' when compiling
        the generated code, it overrides.

Version 4.1.5
2018-May-04

        * Prepare for new Erlang 21 stacktrace syntax. If gpb runs on
        the Erlang 21, or if the {target_erlang_version,N} (-for-version N)
        option is set to 21, then gpb generates code that uses the new
        stacktrace syntax, instead of the deprecated erlang:get_stacktrace/0.

Version 4.1.4
2018-May-04

        * Fix type spec for field of types bytes. Thanks to Marc Nijdam.

Version 4.1.3
2018-Feb-08

        * Build changes: Provide better errors when building
        outside of a git repo, and provide a helper script,
        helers/export-from-git, to extract gpb from git in a way such
        that it can be compiled outside fo git.

Version 4.1.2
2018-Jan-26

        * Fix Dialyzer issues in generated code. This regression was
        introduced already in 3.23.0, but only if the type_specs (-type)
        option was specified. That option was on by default in 4.0.0.
        Thanks to GeraldXv for reporting.

Version 4.1.1
2018-Jan-04

        * Bugfix a renaming check: Check for duplicate rpc names only per
        service. The same rpc name can be used in different services, but in
        4.1.0, this was not allowed. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

Version 4.1.0
2017-Dec-30

        * Rework renaming options, to make it easier to work with grpc
        where package, service and rpc names are exposed. The new
        options are {rename,{What,How}} where What can specify eg msg_name
        or msg_fqname to operate on only the msg name or the fully
        qualified name, ie prepended with package name. How can be eg
        lowercase or snake_case.

        New renaming possibilities for How are: base_name and
        dots_to_underscores.

        The old msg_name_* options are still handled in backwards
        compatible way.

        Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for the suggestions.

Version 4.0.2
2017-Nov-18

        * Prepare for Erlang 21 by using string functions that are new
        in Erlang 20 and stop using the ones that are going to be
        deprecated in Erlang 21.

Version 4.0.1
2017-Nov-07

        * Fix a build issue.

Version 4.0.0
2017-Nov-07

        * When generating for maps, the  maps_unset_optional = omitted
        is now the default. This is an INCOMPATIBILITY. The previous
        default was present_undefined. This incompatibility is also a
        reason for the stepping to a new major version.

        * Type specs are generated by default when possible.
        The option `{type_specs,false}` (-no_type) can be used if
        this is undesirable for some reason.

        * Automatically append current directory, ".", to the include path.

        * Treat dashes and underscores in command line opts equally

        * Refactor code into separate modules (gpb_compile.erl was far
        too long)

        * Rework decoding by breaking out various parts to separate steps.

Version 3.28.1
2017-Nov-02

        * Similar to the fix in 3.28.0, but for encoding: Warn and
        ignore the option packed for repeated fields that are not
        allowed to be packed, such as string, bytes and sub
        messages. Such fields were not allowed to be be packed i the
        first place, but gpb never said anything so this could go
        unnoticed. And gpb packed them in an invalid fasion, that was
        probably incompaitble with other protobuf parsers/encoders.

        For such fields, this introduces a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY,
        in that the invalid option is now ignored and warned about.

        * Add an option {module_name, Name} (-modname Name) for
        entirely controlling the resulting module name, instead of
        only being able to prefix or suffix it. Thanks to
        Tomas Johansson for the suggestion.

        * Wrap decoding in a {gpb_error, {decoding_failure, ...}}
        if it fails. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for the suggestion.

Version 3.28.0
2017-Oct-14

        * Fix decoding of packed/non-packed repeated. If a repeated
        fields was declared as packed, but an encoder encoded it as
        non-packed (or vice versa), then gpb previously failed to decode
        it.

        This introduces a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: For repeated packed
        fields of type string, bytes and sub messages: such fields were
        actually non-packable but gpb accidentally accepted them.
        Messages with such fields were packed invalidly, and gpb of this
        version will not be able to unpack/decode such stored messages.

        Thanks to Moxley Stratton for reporting.

        * Make the -spec for encode_msg more narrow to avoid some
        dialzer underspec warnings.  Note that all underspecs warnings
        can not in general be avoided.  Thanks to Moxley Stratton and
        Kevin C. Baird for fixing and to Heinz N. Gies for reporting.

Version 3.27.7
2017-Sep-19

        * When verifying maps with maps_unset_optional = omitted,
        signal an error if extraneous fields are present, since they
        might be misspellings of optional fields. Thanks to Guilherme Andrade
        for the suggestion to do this.

Version 3.27.6
2017-Aug-19

        * Add type-defaults to proto3 message records. Thanks to Evan
        Vigil-McClanahan and Tristan Sloughter.

Version 3.27.5
2017-Aug-16

        * Apply tolower or snakecase to rpc names as well. Thanks to Tristan
        Sloughter.

        * Fix an edoc generation bug in gpb_parse.yrl with the edoc opt
        {preprocess,true}.

Version 3.27.4
2017-Aug-07

        Minor small issues

        * Fix crash in encoding of string fields in proto3 messages,
        when the string contained code-points >= 256.

        * Fix wrong type-default in encoding for bytes fields in proto3
        messages, when the bytes was specified as an iolist.

        * Improve typespec for map<_,_> type fields to use := in Erlang 19+

        * Fix dialyzer issues in the generated code

        * Fix decoding of map<_,_> type field items with missing keys
        or values so they decode to type-defaults. Thanks to Tiago
        Guedes for reporting.

Version 3.27.3
2017-Jul-10

        * Repeated fields can now be omitted with maps if option
        maps_unset_optional = omitted. This makes sense especially
        for proto3. Thanks to Adam Cook.

        * Parse custom message and field options. Custom message
        options land in {{msg_options,MsgName},[{Name,Value}] items
        in the output when compiling with to_proto_defs. Thanks
        to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

        * Improve unit tests to also cover generated hrl files
        One issue fixed: when only mapfields_as_maps (-mapfields_as_maps)
        but not the maps (-maps) option was set.

Version 3.27.2
2017-Jun-18

        * Bugfix code generation for empty groups.

Version 3.27.1
2017-Jun-16

        * Add support for custom options. Thanks to Geoff Hayes.

Version 3.27.0
2017-May-28

        * Add support for groups. Thanks to David Weinstein for prompting
        this to get implementated.

Version 3.26.8
2017-Mar-24

        * Fix name resolution bugs when extending messages in enclosing
        packages and in other packages. Thanks to Michael Ries for reporting.

Version 3.26.7
2017-Mar-15

        * Fix default for map type fields (map<_,_>) when the
        mapfields_as_maps option is set. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter

Version 3.26.6
2016-Dec-29

        * Improve parser to accept keywords such as "message" also as
        message names. This applies to enums, oneof names as well as
        service and rpc names too. Thanks to ionuthristodorescu for
        reporting.

Version 3.26.5
2016-Dec-10

	* Consider also messages also for map fields when calculating
	order of messages, so that type specs for record fields come in
	the right order. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

Version 3.26.4
2016-Oct-21

	* Add api functions gpb_compile:{locate,read}_import/2 and
	gpb_parse:fetch_imports/1 to facilitate eg proto file dependency
	tracking.

	* Add -types and convert @spec doc tags to proper -specs.

Version 3.26.3
2016-Oct-05

	* Fix dialyzer issue with Erlang 19 in the generated code.  Thanks
	to Sargun Dhillon for reporting. The generated code for merging
	messages unnecessarily/erroneously checked required scalar fields
	for undefined.

Version 3.26.2
2016-Oct-04

	* Integrate with Travis CI. Thanks to Luke Bakken.

	* Improve unit tests:
	- increased timeouts for slow machines
	- eunit test bug fixes for hosts running a 32 bit os
	- bug fix for nif tests for when Google's protobuf library
	  is not installed on the host

Version 3.26.1
2016-Sep-27

	* Don't generate auxiliary functions id/2, cons/3,
	lists_reverse/2, 'erlang_++'/3 if they are not used.
	Thanks to Tristan Sloughter for reporting.

Version 3.26.0
2016-Sep-21

	* New option {target_erlang_version,N}. Thanks to Eric
	Meadows-Jönsson for suggensting this.

	* New options defaults_for_omitted_optionals and
	type_defaults_for_omitted_optionals.  Also improved
	epb_compatibility when fields have [default=...] specified.
	Thanks to Luke Bakken for finding and analyzing this.

	* Fix for accessing bin/protoc-erl via symlinks. Thanks to
	Wang Chao.

	* Clarified licensing conditions. Thanks to Luke Bakken for
	proposing this.

	* Fixes for type-default handling for proto3.

	* Fixes for Erlang 19 (eunit and dialyzer)

Version 3.25.2
2016-Aug-25

	* New options: mapfields_as_maps, defs_as_maps and msgs_as_maps
	(-mapfields-as-maps, -defs-as-maps and -msgs-as-maps). Previously,
	these were all the same maps option, but now the maps option
	merely expands to the above.

Version 3.25.1
2016-Aug-24

	* New option, epb_functions, to control generation of epb
	compatibility functions encode/1, decode/2 etc. The
	epb_compatibility option now implies also epb_functions.

	* Fix for the by_proto sub-option to msg_name_prefix for map-type
	fields. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.

	* Add parsing of stream indicator to rpc service definitions.

	* Fix bug in fetch_rpc_def/2 for options maps (-maps) and
	defs_as_proplists (-pldefs).

Version 3.25.0
2016-Aug-16

	* Fix a crash for message name prefixing and suffixing or
	lower-casing for oneof, and also handle this for map<_,_> fields.
	Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
	* Add an option, msg_name_to_snake_case, to turn SomeMsgName into
	some_msg_name. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
	* Improve rebar3 compatibility. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
	* Make it possible to specify msg name prefix on a per-proto-file
	basis using the by_proto sub-option. Thanks to Tristan Sloughter.
	* Make the epb_compatibility option also imply the
	msg_name_to_lower option, and a "_pb" module_name_suffix option.
	* Add gpb_compile:string/2,3 to compile from a string
	* Add an option, import_fetcher to make it possible to specify
	an alternate source of imported files, instead of using the file
	system.
	* Add examples to the README

Version 3.24.4
2016-Aug-08

	* Proto3: Fix encoding of repeated fields of types string, bytes
	and sub messages. These were erroneously defaulted to packed.
	* Proto3: Fix parsing of unused fields: non-repeated message
	fields are optional, but were erroneously parsed as required,
	thanks to Tyler Margison for fixing.
	* A new Erlang Protobuffs option: epb_compatibility (-epb):
	If this option is specified, generate also functions encode/1,
	decode/1, encode_<MsgName>/1 and decode_<MsgName>/1.
	* Simplified interface for verifying translators for
	google.protobuf.Any messages: the '$errorf' is deprecated.

Version 3.24.3
2016-Jul-29

	* Decode unknown enums to integers. Integers are allowed for
	encoding, for symmetry. Thanks to Eric Meadows-Jönsson for
	suggesting.
	* Fix epb compat function when the .proto contained no
	messages, and the maps option was specified.
	* Fix a bad type spec for the generated encode_msg, to make
	dialyzer happier again about the generated code.

Version 3.24.2
2016-Jul-25

	* Fix parsing of rpc method options. Thanks to Tony Han for
	reporting.

Version 3.24.1
2016-Jul-25

	* In 3.24.0, the input encoding was effectively changed to UTF-8,
	whereas it previously was not defined, but in practice
	it was latin1. Now, both for backwards compatibility, and also
	for similarity with the behaviour of Google protobuf, treat the
	input format as UTF-8 if possible, and fallback to latin1.

Version 3.24.0
2016-Jul-23

	* Several improvements for compatibility with Erlang protobuffs,
	thanks to Luke Bakken for all of these:
	-- bool fields: Accept also 0 and 1 on encoding
	-- bytes fields: Accept also iolists on encoding
	-- API: Add compatibility functions encode/1 and decode/2
	* Accept an UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM). This is accepted by Google
	protobuf 3.0.0. Thanks to Julius Beckmann for highlighting this.
	* Related to the UTF-8 BOM, UTF-8-decode the input .proto files, and
	UTF-8-encode the generated files.

Version 3.23.2
2016-Jul-19

	* Bugfix compilation error with rebar on Erlang R16 and earlier.

Version 3.23.1
2016-Jul-19

	* It is now possible to pass user-data---via an option to the
	generated encode_msg, decode_msg, merge_msgs and verify_msg
	functions---to translators for google.protobuf.Any messages.
	* Type specs for strings now say iolist, because this is what they
	accept on encoding. On decoding, they always return strings or
	binaries depending on the strings_as_binary (-strbin) option.
	* Correct benchmark measurements.

Version 3.23.0
2016-Jul-12

	* Add possibility---the any_translate option---to specify a
	callback for translating (packing on encode and unpacking on
	decode) google.protobuf.Any types.

Version 3.22.5
2016-Jun-30

	* Bugfix a regression, which was introduced in 3.22.4, so that it
	is now again possible use integers for floating point fields, in
	the call to encode_msg. Thanks to Ilya Khaprov for spotting this.

Version 3.22.4
2016-Jun-30

	* For floats, handle infinity, and not a number.  They are
	represented as the atoms infinity, '-infinity' and nan.  Thanks to
	Ilya Khaprov for reporting this and hinting at a solution.

Version 3.22.3
2016-Jun-15

	* Running the eunit tests previously caused the files x.erl and
	x.hrl to be created as a side-effect, this has been fixed: they
	are no longer created.
	* Don't include the timestamp in a comment in the generated source
	code, for the purpose of reproducible builds.

Version 3.22.2
2016-Jun-04

	* For proto3, automatically find well-known types in imports,
	without the user explicitly having to specify include paths.
	This is done by adding an internal include path last.

Version 3.22.1
2016-Jun-03

	* Fix an bug in the generated code in Erlang 17. An attribute to
	mute dialyzer, for generated verifiers, wasn't available until
	Erlang 18, but erroneously used with too old Erlang versions.
	* Fix an bug in the generated code for fields of type
	map<KeyType,ValueType> for Erlang 17. A syntax that wasn't
	available until Erlang 18 was erroneously used already
	with Erlang 17.

Version 3.22.0
2016-Jun-03

	* Add proto3 support to a rudimentary level: support for the new
	syntax and semantics, but not yet any well-known types, or any
	JSON mapping.
	* Fix more dialyzer errors in the generated code.
	* For Erlang 19, use := for the type specs for maps for mandatory
	fields (required and repeated). For earlier Erlang versions,
	fallback to using the => notation.
	* Improve the error when an import file is not found, to make it
	easier to trouble-shoot search path problems.

Version 3.21.3
2016-May-30

	* Add support for extending messages in other packages.  As part
	of this, also fixup resolution of what 'extend' refers to.
	Thanks to Steven Gravell for reporting and providing code
	outlining the way to go.
	* Fix a bug if a message is 'extend'ed more than once.

Version 3.21.2
2016-May-27

	* Make it easier to HiPE compile benchmarks. Thanks to Luke
	Bakken.
	* Fix dialyzer error in the generated code, in verifiers for
	repeated fields, with the -Wunmatched_returns flag to dialyzer.
	Thanks to Luke Bakken for reporting this.

Version 3.21.1
2016-May-25

	* Improve performance slightly for maps by replacing calls to
	maps:find with map matching expressions. On the benchmarks, it
	only yields a 2-7% speedup, but the generated code looks nicer.
	* Refine the type definitions in gpb.hrl
	* Make dialyzer happy about gpb. (It is also happy about generated
	code.)
	* Several benchmark updates:
	-- Make it easier to run benchmarks for code generated with -maps.
	-- Update the benchmarks/README.txt, thanks to Luke Bakken.
	-- Use pkg-config if present to get protobuf lib information,
	   thanks to Luke Bakken.
	-- Use which to find protoc command, else use PROTOC or PROTOHOME,
	   thanks to Luke Bakken.
	-- Pass CXXFLAGS to C++ compiler so that include path to erl_nif.h
	   can be specified, thanks to Luke Bakken.

Version 3.21.0
2016-May-17

	* Add support for map fields, ie fields of type
	map<KeyType,ValueType>. Only scalars (but not enums) and strings
	(not bytes) are allowed as keys. Any type, except maps, is
	allowed as value. Map fields are about to make it into Google
	protobuf 3.0.0, which as of this writing is still in beta. It
	appears it will be available in 3.0.0 for both proto2 and proto3
	syntaxes. (So far, gpb does not support proto3 at all.) Map fields
	have been tested with Google protobuf 3.0.0-beta2.
	The erlang-internal representation of a map<_,_> field is a list
	of 2-tuples---the order is undefined on decoding---or an Erlang map
	if the maps option is used.
	* Some option texts have been improved for the "protoc-erl --help"
	command.
	* With the maps option specified, the generated verifier now produces
	a more helpful error if any non-optional fields are missing from
	the map.
	* The descriptor proto has been updated (the -descr option).
	* The README has been updated.

Version 3.20.3
2016-May-04

	* Encode negative int32 values using 64 bits, for interop with
	other implementations. On decoding, assume either 32 or 64 bit
	encodings can appear. This is what Google's protobuf (C++) does.
	The same goes for negative enums. Thanks to YeJun Su for
	reporting.

Version 3.20.2
2016-Apr-08

	* Don't try to generate default values for maps. Thanks to
	Louis-Philippe Gauthier.
	* Accept the syntax="proto2"; statement, but so far only "proto2".
	Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for suggesting support of the
	syntax statement.

Version 3.20.1
2016-Mar-17

	* Bugfix the generated NIF code: if the .proto file specifies
	package, then any enums must be specified with namespace. Thanks
	to vesperusiak for reporting.

Version 3.20.0
2016-Mar-01

	* Add an option {erlc_compile_options,Str} (-erlc_compile_options Str)
	for inserting a -compile(Str) option into the generated code.
	Thanks to Guilherme Andrade.

Version 3.19.0
2016-Feb-04

	* Add an option msg_name_to_lower (Cmdline: -msgtolower) for
	changing all message name to lower case. Thanks to Roowe.

Version 3.18.10
2015-Nov-27

	* Fix bug with extend inside a message body. Thanks to Michael
	Ries.

Version 3.18.9
2015-Nov-17

	* Support extend inside a message body. Thanks to Michael Ries.

Version 3.18.8
2015-Jun-24

	* Fix another decoding/merging bug for maps with the option
	maps_unset_optional=omitted, this time for oneof with sub messages
	to be merged. This bug, too, was found with the quickcheck and
	gpb-eqc.

Version 3.18.7
2015-Jun-17

	* Fix typos in comments and texts. Thanks to Giacomo Olgeni for
	spotting and fixing many.

Version 3.18.6
2015-Jun-10

	* Implement support for maps in NIFs. As part of this, rework the
	eunit tests to run the NIFs in a separate erlang vm, for stability.

Version 3.18.5
2015-May-29

	* Fix a few decoding/merging bugs for maps with option
	maps_unset_optional set to omitted. The bugs were found with the
	help of quickcheck and the gpb-eqc.
	* The gpb_compile_descr module was forgotten in the gpb.app.src
	file, now it is included.

Version 3.18.4
2015-May-09

	* Include also the build in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
	Holschuh for finding it out.

Version 3.18.3
2015-May-08

	* Include the protoc-erl in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
	Holschuh for finding it out.

Version 3.18.2
2015-May-08

	* Bugfix the version tag in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
	Holschuh.
	* Bugfix decoding, for fields with optional submessages, for maps,
	generated with the option maps_unset_optional set to omitted.

Version 3.18.1
2015-Apr-29

	* Bugfix the helper/package-for-hex.pm about the file name change
	rebar.config -> rebar.config.script

Version 3.18.0
2015-Apr-29

	* Add an option, maps_unset_optional, for omitting optional
	values, for maps. With this option, there can now be an enumerator
	value that is 'undefined' without any confusion if it is
	optional. Thanks to Brett Bethke for prompting this to get
	implemented.
	* Test the generated code also for maps. This is ifdef-protected,
	so it still works with older Erlang versions, but maps are not
	tested then, of course. Due to this, the rebar.config has now
	turned into rebar.config.script.
	* Update the benchmarks to newer software versions and newer
	hardware.

Version 3.17.13
2015-Apr-16

	* Bugfix verification of strings with the strings_as_binary
	(-strbin) option. Thanks to Tilman Holschuh for fixing and to Luis
	Rascão for adding a test for it.

Version 3.17.12
2015-Mar-08

	* Bugfix exported types for CamelCase message names. Thanks to
	Louis-Philippe Gauthier for fixing and to Luis Rascão for adding a
	test for it.

Version 3.17.11
2015-Feb-23

	* When generating typespecs, generate types for messages, and
	export those types. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.10
2015-Feb-17

	* Fix Issues Building on Windows/Cygwin. Thanks to Brett Bethke.

Version 3.17.9
2015-Jan-30

	* When generating typespecs, generate types for enums, and export
	those types. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.8
2015-Jan-25

	* Add support for the enum "option allow_alias = true;" which
	allows more than one enum to have the same numerical value. Gpb
	will decode to the first defined enum symbol. Gpb no longer
	supports allow_alias = false. This option appeared in Google
	Protobuf version 2.5.0. Thanks to bb4242 for reporting.

Version 3.17.7
2015-Jan-07

	* Bugfix type specs for strings when using the strings_as_binaries
	option. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.6
2014-Dec-30

	* Bugfix NIF linking in eunit tests on Mac. Thanks to Luis
	Rascão.

Version 3.17.5
2014-Dec-15

	* Bugfix generated NIF code for with the -strbin option: the
	utf8_to_uint32 function was unused, as was (mostly) the
	utf8_count_codepoints. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
	reporting.

Version 3.17.4
2014-Dec-12

	* Bugfix generated NIF code for enums defined within
	messages. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting and
	providing an initial solution.
	* Bugfix generated NIF code for strings with the -strbin (or
	strings_as_binaries) option. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
	reporting and providing a solution.


Version 3.17.3
2014-Dec-02

	* Bugfix parsing of files that specify a package, and import other
	files that also specify a(nother) package. Thanks to Wang Chao for
	asking the question prompting me to fix this.
	* Add a -pkgs command line option, for use_packages.

Version 3.17.2
2014-Nov-13

	* Rework the option parsing. No functional changes.
	* in helpers/git-hooks/pre-push, allow push of non-tagged
	non-master branches to github.

Version 3.17.1
2014-Oct-29

	* Bugfix decoding oneof when for sub messages, in the data-driven
	decoder in gpb. When the same oneof sub message appeared twice,
	the oneof field was overwritten instead of merged. This did not
	affect generated code. It only affected the gpb:decode_msg/3.

Version 3.17.0
2014-Oct-26

	* Support oneof fields. It appeared in protobuf 2.6.0, and is
	essentially several optional fields sharing the same record
	position (memory in the C++ alternative).
	* Make the name of the two records for fields and rpcs
	configurable. They ought to have been prefixed with gpb_ long ago,
	but that was not done. At least now, it is possible to redefine
	the record names, in case of clashes.
	* Handle services in descriptors.
	* Bugfix compilation for descriptors.
        * Add an option `warnings_as_errors' along with command line
	options -Werror, -Wall, -W1, -W0 and -W, that mimimcs the options
	to erlc. This also adds a new return value for failures: error.

Version 3.16.0
2014-Oct-13

	* When generating NIF code, also do the encoding in the
	NIF. Previously, the encoding was still done using plain Erlang,
	only decoding was in the NIF. Now the NIF does both encoding and
	decoding.
	* Fix potential memory leak when decoding, for odd/unusual error
	cases.

Version 3.15.0
2014-Oct-13

	* Specify that the NIF should run in a cpu-bound dirty scheduler
	when supported. This currently requires Erlang 17.3 built with
	--enable-dirty-schedulers. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
	asking the question, prompting me get it done.

Version 3.14.0
2014-Oct-01

	* In the Makefile, allow ERL and ERLC to be overridden via
	environment variables, thanks to Graham Crowe.
	* Avoid, and attempt to handle, unicode output in compilation
	errors in eunit tests.

Version 3.13.0
2014-Sep-17

	* New way to invoke the compiler: bin/protoc-erl. Thanks to Luis
	Rascão for the implementation.

Version 3.12.2
2014-Sep-16

	* Fix a race condition in the Makefile between all and doc
	* Elide falsely failing nif tests with 17 on 32 bits with an
	erlang vm compiled with gcc 4.9.0 or newer.

Version 3.12.1
2014-Aug-12

	* Update the README, with info on meta data for services. Thanks
	to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.12.0
2014-Aug-12

	* Add support for retrieving meta data for services. Rename
	gpb_compile:msg_defs/2,3 into gpb_compile:proto_defs/2,3, but
	retain the old function name and option names for backwards
	compatibility. Thanks to Luis Rascão for the implementation.

Version 3.11.0
2014-Jul-20

	* Add helpers for packaging to hex.pm. Thanks to Dylan Lukes and
	Paul Schoenfelder for prompting this.
	* Version numbers revisited, the version on github is now intended
	to always be reltools compliant, ie: to always consist of only
	integers and dots. Thanks to Volodymyr Kyrychenko
	for taking the initiative to this.

Version 3.10
2014-Jun-26

	* Bugfix verification of optional sub message fields, thanks to
	Klas Johansson.
	* Fix compilation warnings with Erlang/OTP 17.0
	* Improve/bugfix eunit tests in gpb_codegen_tests and
	gpb_compile_tests (compilation warning and nif include path issue,
	respectively)

Version 3.9
2014-Feb-04

	* Avoid single field map access---ie expressions on the form
	X#{key}---since neither the maps pre-release, nor the rc1 of R17
	supports it. Use matching to access such fields instead. This
	applies to records as well as maps. Performance is unaltered.

Version 3.8
2014-Feb-01

	* Bugfix generated code when there are no messages defined.
	Thanks to Graham Crowe for reporting.
	* Add possibility to suffix message/record and names and module
	names.

Version 3.7.1
2013-Dec-14

	* Bugfix a race condition in the Makefile. Thanks to Graham Crowe
	for fruitful discussions.
	* Rework the workaround for the bug in the syntax_tools in R16B03,
	so that the code that uses the parse transform need not change.
	Handle the odd case entirely in the parse transform.

Version 3.7
2013-Dec-13

	* Add a (GNU) Makefile, for projects that prefer to build this
	way. Thanks to Graham Crowe for suggestions and ideas.
	* Rework/fix the substitution in gpb_version.hrl.
	* Add support for Erlang/OTP R16B03, by working around a
	bug in syntax_tools (reversion of local implicit funs).
	* Change the months in this file, from numeric to 3-letters, to
	avoid ambiguities with different ways of writing dates in various
	parts of the world.

Version 3.6
2013-Nov-13

	* Add nif support for the strings_as_binaries (-strbin) option,
	thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting this.
	* Add an is_binary guard to the top-level generated decode_msg/2
	function. Thanks to Klas Johansson for suggesting this.

Version 3.5
2013-Oct-27

	* Licence change: from LGPL 2 to LGPL 2.1

Version 3.4
2013-Oct-27

	* Licence modification/clarification: clarify that the licence (in
	the file COPYING.LIB) does not cover code generated with gpb.

Version 3.3
2013-Oct-27

	* Fix several errors in the gpb.app.src so that it works with
	Elixir and Relex, thanks to Paulo Almeida.
	* When decoding, reject messages with invalid varints.
	Invaid varints are encoded with too many bits. Previously,
	decoding a varint with very many bits (ie: with very many leading
	bytes > 128) would cause the Erlang VM to construct a very large
	number when decoding the varint. This would cause the Erlang VM to
	use excessive cpu resources and could eventually cause the Erlang
	VM to run out of memory. Now parsing fails immediately reading too
	many varint bits.
	* Fix a bug when generating code for maps.
	* Teach the benchmarks to do maps, and also improve
	various other benchmark related things.

Version 3.2
2013-Sep-16

	* Add preliminary support for maps, for generating code that
	encodes from and decodes to maps, as well as merges and verifies
	maps. The maps support is experimental.
	* Bugfix verification of integers: the wrong error reason could be
	generated for integers out of range.
	* Bugfix various dialyzer issues.

Version 3.1
2013-Sep-05

	* Bugfix compilation of several files (only the first file
	was actually compiled, even if several files were specified)
	* Add possibility to generate and encode a descriptor, which is a
	self-describing byte-blob according to descriptor.proto.
	* Add possibility to make the generated code compile-time
	independent of gpb by generating the introspection information to
	proplists instead of to #field{} records. The latter required
	including gpb.hrl at compiletime. (There's no run-time dependency)
	* Add possibility to prefix message/record and names and module
	names to avoid name collisions.
	* Add -type to the command line options, thanks to Louis-Philippe
	Gauthier. Previously it existed only as an Erlang API option.

Version 3.0
2013-Aug-24
	* Improve decoding performance by roughly 8--19%
	* Completely rewrite the code generator. Use a parse-transform
	  instead of formatting and assembling strings.
	* Minor improvement in the generated code for version_as_list.

Version 2.3
2013-Aug-18
	* Fix Rebar compile on non-GNU systems, such as Mac OS X, thanks
	to Everton Ribeiro.
	* Bugfix (mostly) rare compilation breakage: depending on the
	date/time of generation, a new-line was inserted, causing a
	compilation error.
	* Ignore non-version-like tags

Version 2.2
2013-Jul-13

	* Wrap generated skip-functions with quotes. Thanks to jesse-ad.
	* Experimental support for calling protoc code via a NIF
	* Empty lists are now default values for repeated fields. Thanks
	to Martin Donath.
	* New option, use_packages for prepending the package name found
	in the proto file, to the message names. Thanks to Martin Donath.
	* New option: strings_as_binaries (-strbin), for returning strings
	as binaries. Thanks to Lars Thorsen for suggesting this option.
	* New option: {o_erl,Dir} (-o-erl Dir), {o_hrl,Dir} (-o-hrl Dir)
	and {o_nif_cc,Dir} (-o-nif-cc Dir) to specify destination
	directory by file type. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting
	those options.
	* New option: include_as_lib (-il) to include gpb.hrl as a
	library. This makes it easier to integrate with rebar. Thanks to
	Martin Donath.
	* Generate introspection functions for enum conversions:
	M:enum_symbol_by_value/2, M:enum_value_by_symbol/2,
	M:enum_symbol_by_value_<Enum>/1, M:enum_value_by_symbol_<Enum>/1;
	thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting those functions.
	* Bugfix name resolution. Thanks to Heiner Bunjes for reporting
	the bug. This prompted a major rewrite of the name resolution code
	that was originally a quick patch-work, and not in very good shape.
	* Handle C-style comments. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for reporting
	this bug.
	* Add a section to the README.md showing rebar integration, thanks
	to Bin Wang for asking the question that prompted me to write it
	up.
	* Bugfix command line option parsing using the -extra alternative.
	* Benchmark code improvements.
	* Build: version number: defined format and enforced/verified
	consistency between gpb_version.hrl and src/gpb.app.src: using the
	git tag as the source of information.

Version 2.1
2011-Oct-31  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tomas.abrahamsson@gmail.com>

	* Package names are dotted rather than with underscores
	* New generated introspection function: M:get_package_name/0.

Version 2.0
2011-Jul-10  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tab@lysator.liu.se>

	* First public version
